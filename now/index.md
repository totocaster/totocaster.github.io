As of late March 2017, I am in living Japan with my wife. While she is doing her Masters degree I'm focused on things below:

- iOS consulting work,
- Programming [Forged App][ff],
- Improving [Energy app][ea],
- [Running or cycling][tl] every single day.

I update this list time to time. It serves as a good reminder of what I should be focusing on. Not that I have problem focusing.

## Active Projects

- [Energy App][ea] --- Manual calorie counting app I use every single day.
- [Code, Design &amp; Coffee](/) --- this very website.
- [The Forged App][fj] --- I'm working on [fitness app][fpost] and I also document most of the design and development process, training multi-sport and everything around it.
