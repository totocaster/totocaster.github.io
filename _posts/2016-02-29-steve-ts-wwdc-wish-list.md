Interesting list with lots of great points. Nothing seems unrealistic, even this one:

> Terminal environment for iOS [...] I would be so happy to see a Terminal/BSD environment on iOS, even if it were limited to its own sandbox and not the OS filesystem. Let technical users build the kinds of things that technical users need, that can't be addressed in any other way by a GUI iOS. The only way I see Apple committing to this is if it were completely jailed from the rest of the OS - but even that would be a major step forward (or, backward, depending on your point of view).

I use hosted Linux box and [Prompt][pp] to simulate this, it works great but having terminal session running on device would be truly amazing. Terminal app can be hidden deep in settings, very much like iCloud Drive on iOS and _Develop_ menu in Safari on OS X.
