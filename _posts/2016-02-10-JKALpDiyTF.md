Hi, this is a [snippet][mb]. Snippets, or microposts, are short blog entries that are too long for Twitter, but too short (or out of scope) for dedicated article. Snippets on this website are unorganized by design. This makes it easy for me to write pretty much about anything that comes to my mind worth sharing. Hope you enjoy them. There even is dedicated micropost only [RSS](/rss) feed this website.
