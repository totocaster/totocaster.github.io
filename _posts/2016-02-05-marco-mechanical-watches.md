> [...] I simply like mechanical watches more. I've completely converted, and I don't foresee myself wearing the Apple Watch much in the future --- the additional functionality it offers isn't useful enough to me (your needs may vary) to overcome the far greater joy I get out of wearing a nice mechanical watch.

Fascinating. If anything the Apple Watch made me realize that I'll never want a traditional watch again. I'm still into mechanical watches as I was before, but Apple Watch is so much better tool for everyday life (even with its current software issues) that I'm willing to sacrifice joy of wearing different kinds of watches.

> And, actually, it's pretty nice to have the time on your wrist. Who knew?
