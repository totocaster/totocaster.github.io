> Very special guests Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi join the show. Topics include: the new features in Apple's upcoming OS releases (iOS 9.3 and tvOS 9.2); why Apple is expanding its public beta program for OS releases; iTunes's monolithic design; how personally involved Eddy and Craig are in using, testing, and installing beta software; the sad decline of Duke's men's basketball team; and more.

Many will say that John was too soft (he was not) and both Eddy and Craig were vague on software quality issues (they were, a bit).

None of this matters. Great episode. Message was delivered.
