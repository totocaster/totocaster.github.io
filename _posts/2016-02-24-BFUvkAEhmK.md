Disappointed after watching [Point Break][pb], remake of [1994][pb94] sports classic. Out of curiosity, visited IMDB page --- 5.4 rating, no surprising. I've also noticed common theme among user reviews: _"GoPro and Red Bull decided to shoot a movie"_. Ironically, Red Bull does indeed shoot documentary sports movies, and they are [way better][af] than that.
